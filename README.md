# Practice - FBI Fetch

## Fetch API practice

Found an FBI Wanted API to use for this personal project. This is meant to get more comfortable in how fetches work.

### API

URL used (JSON Output): [https://api.fbi.gov/wanted/v1/list]("https://api.fbi.gov/wanted/v1/list")

[FBI Wanted API]("https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/api)

### Features

- Use Fetch on an API

- Add Title, Eye Color, Hair Color, Race
- Use CSS Grid for page layout
- Use at least one Event Listener
